# chat-app

## Hello!! ðŸ‘‹

This is my first app created using React Native. It is a chat app where users can share images and their location.

### Design

<img width="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76042761/193648166-cd38cab9-5ac2-4fb6-ba34-c35d822df75b.PNG"> <img width="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76042761/193648565-8873b0e8-13d5-42ff-a1d8-0e4a8c7329e3.PNG">

### Key Features
- A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
- A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
- The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images and location data.
- Data gets stored online and offline.
